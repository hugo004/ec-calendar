"ec_intro" = "Why we need to reform the calendar?\n\nAs a calendar for organizing our daily activities, the current calendar is certainly an over-complicated calendar system.\nIt is the oldest system that we are using daily, that it is not an efficient calendar system for the modern world & business.\nIt confuses our memory. We are difficult to align our memory month by month, quarter by quarter, or year by year because of the annual calendar renewal.\nIt wastes our resource to produce tons of new calendars annually. It wastes our time and effort to rearrange annual events and plans.\n It affects the precision the periodically statistics, that adjustments are sometimes required because of the inconsistent month lengths.\nAlmost all companies have dedicated staff to handle the annual difference of the calendar. It is definitely not economically efficient. \n\nEC-Calendar Key Characteristics\n\n1. It is a Perennial Calendar that one calendar for any year.\n2. It uses the same months & dates, but has a smarter system of weeks.\n3. It is highly compatible with the current calendar system. Thus, two calendarsystems can be run in parallel.\n4. It has consistent 52 weeks per year.\n5. Each year simply starts on Monday and ends on Sunday.\n6. All quarters have consistent 65 weekdays and 13 Saturdays.\n7. Only 1st quarter starts on Monday. Other quarters start on Sunday.\n8. There is an Annual Double Sunday (Sep. 30 + Oct. 1) in the week 39.\n9. There is a Leap-year Double Sunday (March 31 + April 1) in the week 13 of the leap year. (It fixed the short month issue. February has regular 29 days)\n10. It introduces the least change with minimal transition cost.It is quite easy to use & adopt that have no impact on the presence.";
